-> correspondência entre nodes do .INCLUDE e do arquivo final .SPICE
	pq: quando add um subckt no circuito, a ordem dos terminais conectados é a msm da
	    declaracao do subckt
	    
-> o arquivo 6_final.spice n é o arquivo final a ser simulado; ele ainda é inserido no testbench

---------------------------------

0. converter estrutura do .cdl em .spice
1. ver a ordem q ta no .INCLUDE
2. ver a ordem q ta no .cdl
3. reordenar se necessário (conforme equivalência de pinos)
	-> nome dos pinos: vem do .cdl
	-> ordem dos pinos: vem do .INCLUDE
	-> relacao entre nome e ordem: vem do .lef? N SEI DE QUAL!
	
---------------------------------

[easy solution] It looks to me that the order of the pins is the same in the std .spice file (openfasoc/common/platforms/sky130hd/cdl/sky130_fd_sc_hd.spice) and in the input cdl file (openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/flow/results/sky130hd/tempsense/6_final.cdl), so I just changed the name of the pins to get the output .spice file.

Of course, while also replacing r_VIN with VIN for the HEADER cells.

[more robust solution] However, what if one pin in one of the components does not correspond? Or what if an update in OpenROAD changes this order?

The correct way to do this would be to:
- get the required pin order from the std .spice file
- get the pin names from the input cdl file (their names define the connections)
- substitute the correct pin names into the ordered pins and put this in the output file

In order to do that, there must be a file (probably from OpenROAD) that marks the equivalence between a pin from the std .spice file and from the input cdl file (generated by OpenROAD). I thought this "equivalence" file was the LEF used for the old script, but it does not have the same order as the cdl file.

TO SEARCH BEFORE CALL:

openfasoc/common/drc-lvs-check/run_lvspex.sh file
-> last command: netgen -batch lvs $2_lvsmag.spice $2.spice $COMMON_VERIF_DIR/sky130A/sky130A_setup.tcl $3 -full ($2.spice is the generated spice file from the cdl parser). What does it do?


+ run_lvspex.sh : I forgot what was wrong with this file and forgot the notes in Paris... could you remind me again?
